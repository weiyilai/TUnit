# HTML Test Report

TUnit automatically generates a rich HTML test report after every test run. No configuration is needed — the report is always on by default.

## Report Location

After running your tests, the report is written to:

```
TestResults/{AssemblyName}-{os}-{tfm}-report.html
```

For example: `TestResults/MyTests-linux-net10.0-report.html`

The OS and runtime version are included automatically so that matrix builds (multiple platforms/TFMs) produce distinct files instead of overwriting each other.

Open it in any modern browser. The report is fully self-contained (single HTML file) and works offline.

## Features

- **Summary Dashboard** — Total, passed, failed, skipped, and cancelled counts with a visual pass-rate donut chart
- **Expandable Test Details** — Click any test to see exception details, stack traces, stdout/stderr output, timing breakdown, categories, and custom properties
- **Search** — Type-ahead search to quickly filter tests by name, class, or category
- **Status Filters** — Filter by All, Passed, Failed, Skipped, or Cancelled
- **Class Grouping** — Tests are grouped by class with collapsible sections. Groups with failures auto-expand.
- **OpenTelemetry Trace Timeline** — When your tests use `System.Diagnostics.Activity`, a waterfall timeline shows nested spans with durations
- **Retry Support** — Tests with retries show the final result with a retry badge

## Configuration

### Custom Output Path

```bash
dotnet run -- --report-html-filename my-custom-report.html
```

### Disable Report Generation

Set the environment variable:

```bash
export TUNIT_DISABLE_HTML_REPORTER=true
```

Accepts: `true`, `1`, `yes` (case-insensitive).

### Deprecated: `--report-html` Flag

The `--report-html` flag is deprecated since the report is now generated by default. Using it will show a deprecation warning but will not cause an error.

## GitHub Actions Integration

When TUnit detects it is running inside GitHub Actions (`GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`), it will:

1. **Upload the report as a workflow artifact** (if the required runtime token is available)
2. **Add a link to the GitHub step summary** so you can find the report directly from the workflow run page

### Enabling Automatic Artifact Upload

GitHub Actions does not expose `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN` to shell `run:` steps by default — it is only available inside JavaScript and Docker action handlers. To make it available to your test process, add **one** of the following steps **before** your test step.

#### Option A: `actions/github-script` (recommended, first-party)

```yaml
- name: Expose GitHub Actions Runtime
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      core.exportVariable('ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN', process.env['ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN']);
      core.exportVariable('ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL', process.env['ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL']);

- name: Run Tests
  run: dotnet run --project MyTests
```

#### Option B: `crazy-max/ghaction-github-runtime`

```yaml
- name: Expose GitHub Actions Runtime
  uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-runtime@v3

- name: Run Tests
  run: dotnet run --project MyTests
```

#### Option C: Manual `upload-artifact` step

If you prefer not to expose the runtime token, you can upload the report yourself:

```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  run: dotnet run --project MyTests

- name: Upload HTML Test Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always()
  with:
    name: TestReport
    path: '**/*-report.html'
```

### Viewing the Report

After the workflow run completes:

1. Go to the workflow run page
2. Look for the artifact link in the step summary (Options A/B), or
3. Find the report in the **Artifacts** section at the bottom of the page (all options)

## Troubleshooting

### Report Not Generated

- Check that `TUNIT_DISABLE_HTML_REPORTER` is not set in your environment
- Verify that the `TestResults/` directory is writable
- Check the console output for any warning messages about report generation failures

### Large Test Suites

For test suites with 1,000+ tests, the report uses client-side rendering from embedded JSON data. All search and filtering happens in the browser without page reloads.

### Trace Timeline Not Showing

The trace timeline requires `System.Diagnostics.Activity` spans to be active during the test run. If your tests don't create activities, the trace section won't appear. TUnit's internal activities are captured automatically on .NET 8.0+.
